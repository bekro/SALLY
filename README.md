# S.A.L.L.Y.

We would like to connect a Raspberry Pi via USB to a telescope.

With that connection we would like to be able to control the telescope via console.

However, if necessary, use GPS and compass data for triangulation. (But most telescope mounts can do that already.)

The main benefit should be that you can use the Pi as a bridge to control the telescope via LAN / WLAN.

Additional Goals: 
- transfer image data from a web cam to the computer
- easy-to-use json-api that can be accessed from any source
